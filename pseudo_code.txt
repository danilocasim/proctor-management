// Proctoring Management System - Exam Scheduling Algorithm
// Enhanced Algorithm with Optimization for Room and Proctor Allocation

// 1. SYSTEM CONSTANTS
// ------------------
// Exam Duration Constants
- Standard exam duration: 1 hour 30 minutes (90 minutes)
- Extended exam duration (for special needs): 2 hours (120 minutes)

// Time Constants
- Morning session start: 8:00 AM
- Afternoon session start: 1:00 PM
- Lunch break: 11:30 AM - 1:00 PM (90 minutes)
- Short break between exams: 30 minutes

// 2. SCHEDULING CONSTRAINTS
// --------------------------
// Per Section Constraints
- Maximum subjects per section per day: 3
- Preferred maximum subjects per section per day: 2
- Minimum time between exams for same section: 30 minutes
- Default exam days: Monday to Saturday (6 days)

// Room Constraints
- Room capacity must exceed or equal number of students in a section
- Special needs students require designated rooms
- Certain subjects may require specific types of rooms (e.g., labs)

// Proctor Constraints
- Each exam room requires at least one proctor
- Rooms with more than 30 students require two proctors
- Maximum number of proctoring sessions per proctor per day: 3
- Minimum break between proctoring sessions: 30 minutes

// 3. OPTIMIZATION OBJECTIVES
// --------------------------
// Primary Objectives
- Minimize total number of exam days
- Minimize number of rooms needed
- Ensure optimal proctor utilization
- Ensure same subjects across sections are scheduled simultaneously

// Secondary Objectives
- Prefer morning slots over afternoon slots when possible
- Minimize back-to-back exams for students within a day
- Balance proctor workload across available proctors
- Minimize room changes for a section throughout exam period

// 4. SCHEDULING ALGORITHM
// -----------------------
// STEP 1: INITIALIZATION
- Initialize all required variables and parameters
- Set exam duration, max subjects per day, available days
- Create empty schedule matrix (Day x Time x Room)
- Create student section mapping
- Create subject-section mapping
- Initialize proctor availability matrix

// STEP 2: DATA COLLECTION AND VALIDATION
- Import courses, sections, subjects, rooms, and proctors data
- Use Excel as data source for collections and to read the other excel sheets
- Validate data integrity (no missing values, no duplicates)
- Check for initial obvious conflicts
- Calculate total number of exams needed across all sections
- Estimate minimum required exam days and rooms

// STEP 3: SUBJECT CLUSTERING
- Group subjects by course and year
- Identify subjects taught across multiple sections
- Prioritize subjects by:
  * Subjects common across most sections (highest priority)
  * Subjects with specific room requirements
  * Subjects with larger student counts

// STEP 4: DAY ALLOCATION
- Distribute subjects across available days following these rules:
  * Rule 1: Allocate at most 3 subjects per section per day
  * Rule 2: Schedule same subjects for different sections on same day
  * Rule 3: Balance subject difficulty within a day (if difficulty metadata available)
  * Rule 4: Allocate subjects with special requirements first
- For each day:
  * Morning slot 1: 8:00 AM - 9:30 AM
  * Morning slot 2: 10:00 AM - 11:30 AM
  * Afternoon slot 1: 1:00 PM - 2:30 PM
  * Afternoon slot 2: 3:00 PM - 4:30 PM

// STEP 5: TIME SLOT ALLOCATION
- For each day:
  * Assign highest priority subjects to earliest available slots
  * Ensure subjects common to multiple sections get same time slot
  * Apply time constraints (lunch breaks, minimum gaps between exams)
  * If a section has multiple exams in a day, ensure adequate breaks

// STEP 6: ROOM ASSIGNMENT
- Initialize room availability matrix for each time slot
- For each scheduled exam:
  * Sort rooms by capacity (smallest suitable room first)
  * Check if section had a previous exam that day:
    - If yes, try to assign same room for continuity
    - If not possible, find closest available room
  * Assign room with capacity >= section size
  * For exams across multiple sections:
    - Ensure rooms are in same building if possible
  * Mark room as occupied for the time slot
  * Update room availability matrix

// STEP 7: PROCTOR ASSIGNMENT
- Initialize proctor availability matrix
- For each scheduled exam with assigned room:
  * Calculate required number of proctors based on student count
  * Check for faculty members who teach the subject
    - Preferably assign different proctors than subject teachers
  * Check proctor expertise and preferences if available
  * Select available proctors with fewest assignments
  * Ensure proctor has adequate breaks between assignments
  * If proctor shortage, identify and resolve (request additional proctors)

// STEP 8: CONFLICT RESOLUTION
- Identify all scheduling conflicts:
  * Room double-bookings
  * Section scheduled for multiple exams simultaneously
  * Proctor double-bookings
  * Insufficient breaks between exams
- For each conflict:
  * Try room reassignment first
  * If unsuccessful, try time slot reassignment
  * If unsuccessful, try day reassignment
  * Log unresolvable conflicts for manual review

// STEP 9: OPTIMIZATION
- Evaluate current schedule against optimization objectives
- Apply iterative improvements:
  * Minimize room changes for sections
  * Balance proctor workload
  * Reduce total rooms used by consolidating when possible
  * Reduce total days if possible
- Repeat until no further improvements or max iterations reached

// STEP 10: SCHEDULE FINALIZATION
- Generate final schedule with all assignments:
  * Day and date
  * Time slot
  * Subject
  * Sections
  * Room
  * Assigned proctors
- Calculate and report statistics:
  * Total exam days used
  * Total rooms used
  * Average exams per day
  * Proctor utilization rate
  * Student exam density (exams per day)

// STEP 11: OUTPUT GENERATION
- Generate master schedule for administration
- Generate per-section schedules for students
- Generate per-room schedules for facility management
- Generate per-proctor schedules
- Export in multiple formats (PDF, Excel, web view)
- Provide API endpoints for integration with other systems

// STEP 12: MONITORING AND ADJUSTMENT
- Allow for manual adjustments to the generated schedule
- Record changes and reasons for future algorithm improvement
- Provide real-time monitoring during exam period
- Support last-minute changes (proctor absence, room unavailability)
- Collect feedback for future optimization
